ProfMapr
========

Flash-based web app for the geolocation of CSCI professors within the Science and Math building at the University of Minnesota: Morris. Developed by Eugene Butler and Missy Helgeson in Spring 2010.

Features
--------
Multiple floors, professor icons act as links to professor schedules and websites. 

Geolocation
-----------
All geolocative heavy lifting was done through [InstaMapper](www.instamapper.com), but professor locations are no longer being tracked and API key has been removed from code.
